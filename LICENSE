ðŸ‘‘ KewC Client Official Rules (License Thingy) ðŸ‘‘

READ THIS WHOLE THING! If you use my client, you are agreeing to these super important rules. If you don't agree, then don't use it! Simple as that.

1. WHO IS THE BOSS? (The Owner Rule)

This entire thing, the KewC Client, all the awesome features, all the codeâ€”it all belongs to KingCanvas. That's me. I am the sole, 100% owner. Don't forget it, and don't try to say it's yours. Itâ€™s my creation and itâ€™s mine forever.

2. DON'T CRACK IT! (No Modifying or Stealing Source Code/Assets)

This is the most important rule. You are NOT allowed to mess with the client's insides. I mean it!

NO looking at the source code (it's not allowed to be cracked!).

NO changing any of the code. If you try to modify it, you are breaking the rules. My code is perfect the way it is, thanks.

NO stealing the client's textures, icons, sounds, or other assets either. Those are protected too!

NO trying to copy it and call it your own client. Thatâ€™s just super lame.

If I find out you tried to mess with the files or crack the client, I will be super mad, and you are not allowed to use the client anymore. Seriously.

3. I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP (No Pull Requests/Contributions)

I got this! I know how to update the client and fix bugs. Iâ€™m the coder here.

You are NOT allowed to send me "pull requests" (that's when people try to add their own code).

If you find a bug, tell me about it, but I will fix it. I don't need random people trying to add stuff.

4. YOU BREAK IT, YOU BOUGHT IT (No Refunds, No Fault)

Listen up, this client is totally free because I'm cool, but that means it comes AS IS.

If you use KewC and your PC explodes, or you get banned from your favorite server, or Minecraft crashes, or anything else bad happensâ€”that is 100% your problem.

I'm not responsible for anything that happens to you or your computer or your Minecraft account. You chose to use the client. Don't come crying to me!

And since it's free, there are NO REFUNDS, duh.

5. I CAN CHANGE MY MIND (Rule Updates)

I'm the owner, so I have the power to update this KewC Client Official Rules whenever I feel like it.

Maybe I'll add a new rule tomorrow. I don't have to ask you or tell you way ahead of time.

It's your job to check this license sometimes to make sure you didn't miss any new rules. If you keep using the client, you agree to whatever new rule I add.

6. DON'T TRY TO MAKE MONEY OFF OF MY WORK (No Commercial Use/Selling Services)

My client is a gift to the PVP community, not a business for you.

NO selling KewC client in any way, shape, or form. You can't charge people to use it.

NO making bundles with KewC and then selling the bundle.

NO selling or charging money for configurations, mods, or services (like "KewC setup help") that only work with my client.

If you use KewC in a YouTube video, you can monetize the video (I guess), but you CANNOT put the client behind a paywall, link shortener, or subscription where people have to pay to download it. It stays free!

7. YOU HAVE TO SAY MY NAME (Credit is Required)

If you're going to use the client in public, you better let people know who made the heat.

If you stream with KewC or make a video using it, you MUST put this link: https://github.com/KingCanvas02437/kewc-client-public in the description box. That is the ONLY official link you can use!

The link has to be the first one, too, not way down at the bottom!

Also, you should probably say my name, KingCanvas, out loud, so people know who the real GOAT is.

8. NO REROUTING! (You Can't Re-Upload the File)

This rule is to make sure everyone is downloading the safe, real version of KewC.

You are NOT allowed to re-upload the client files anywhere (like on Discord, Google Drive, MediaFire, or your own website).

If you want to share KewC with your friends, you MUST ONLY send them the official GitHub link mentioned in Rule 7. Don't be lazy!

The FINAL Final Part

This license is active the second you run KewC Client. If you break any of these EIGHT rules, you are a cheater and you lose your right to use the BEST 1.8.9 PVP client ever created.

Have fun, and donâ€™t crack my client!
