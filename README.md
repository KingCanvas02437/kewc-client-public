🛑 <span class="rule-header">THE 3 MOST IMPORTANT RULES (YOU MUST KNOW)</span> 🛑

We have a long list of rules in the license (see below), but here are the three things that will get you BANNED from using the client immediately:

DO NOT CRACK IT: You cannot look at, modify, or steal the source code or any assets (textures, sounds). This is Rule 2 and it’s NON-NEGOTIABLE!

DO NOT SELL IT: KewC is 100% FREE. You can't charge money for the file, re-upload it to a paywall, or sell custom configs for it. (Rule 6)

GIVE CREDIT: If you make a YouTube video or stream using KewC, you MUST put the official link above in the description box, and it has to be the FIRST LINK! (Rule 7)

🛡️ THE WHOLE RULEBOOK (The Official License) 🛡️

If you use the client, you agree to all EIGHT of my official rules. NO EXCEPTIONS! Don't say KingCanvas didn't warn you!
